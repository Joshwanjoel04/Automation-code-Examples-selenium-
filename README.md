## Prerequisites

Before using this test automation framework, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG Testing Framework
- Web browser drivers (ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc.)
- [Add any other dependencies or prerequisites]

## Framework Structure

The framework is structured as follows:

- `com.webpageAutomation.qa.base`: Contains the `TestBase` class, which sets up the WebDriver and common configurations.
- `com.webpageAutomation.qa.pages`: Contains page object classes representing different pages of the web application.
- `com.webpageAutomation.qa.testcases`: Contains test classes that use the page objects to perform test scenarios.
- [Add any other folders or packages as needed]

## Usage

To use this framework for testing, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-automation-framework.git
   ```

2. Set up the required prerequisites mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

3. Configure the `config.properties` file in the `com.webpageAutomation.qa.config` package with your desired browser and URL settings.

4. Create and run your test classes in the `com.webpageAutomation.qa.testcases` package. Make sure to extend the `TestBase` class and utilize the page objects from the `com.webpageAutomation.qa.pages` package.

## Test Cases

The provided sample test case is located in `HomePageTest.java`:

- `HomePageTest`: This test class initializes the WebDriver, navigates to the homepage, and executes a test method to interact with the homepage elements.

You can create additional test classes and test methods as needed to cover various test scenarios.
